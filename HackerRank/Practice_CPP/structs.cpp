/*
struct is a way to combine multiple fields to represent a composite data structure, which further lays the foundation for Object Oriented Programming. For example, we can store details related to a student in a struct consisting of his age (int), first_name (string), last_name (string) and standard (int).

struct can be represented as

struct NewType {
    type1 value1;
    type2 value2;
    .
    .
    .
    typeN valueN;
};
You have to create a struct, named Student, representing the student's details, as mentioned above, and store the data of a student.

Input Format

Input will consist of four lines.
The first line will contain an integer, representing age.
The second line will contain a string, consisting of lower-case Latin
 characters ('a'-'z'), representing the first_name of a student.
The third line will contain another string, consisting of lower-case
 Latin characters ('a'-'z'), representing the last_name of a student.
The fourth line will contain an integer, representing the standard of
student.

Note: The number of characters in first_name and last_name will not exceed 50.

Output Format

Output will be of a single line, consisting of age, first_name,
last_name and standard, each separated by one white space.

P.S.: I/O will be handled by HackerRank.
